This example is based on the assumption that there is a SPARQL enpoint available running on the localhost. The example has been tested with Fuseki server with an empty repository "subdiv" available.      


To load two versions of the Subdivisions dataset (an authority list from European Publications Office) run the command below.  

```
../../bin/load_versions.sh -f ./subdiv.config
```
